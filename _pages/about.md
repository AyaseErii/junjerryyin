# Welcome to Jun's homepage!

&emsp;

## Short Bio

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the University of Virginia (UVA) advised by Prof. [Mircea R. Stan](https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/mircea-r-stan). I received the M.S. degree in Materials Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University (THU) and the M.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from UVA. My research interests are ultra-low-power memory circuit design, energy-efficient emerging memory design and fabrication for Computing-In-Memory, highly sensitive RF energy harvesting circuits and systems, digital VLSI design, and analog mixed-signal IC design. I published over ten papers in both peer-reviewed high-impact journals and conferences on the cross-field of electronic device fabrication and IC design, including Science Advances, Advanced Functional Materials, ISCAS, ISQED, GLSVLSI, etc., with a total citation of 750+ and an H-index of 8. I am a Graduate Student Member of IEEE and a 59th DAC Young Fellow. I served as a reviewer in IEEE TVLSI, IEEE Access, Integration, GLSVLSI, PRIME, VLSI-SoC, etc.
